Hey kid,

If you're reading this, I just wanted to say thanks. I don't know what I'm going to do next, but I need to move on.

Sorry about the gun, and thanks for helping me through a hard time.

Look, this is too much, even from you. Touch my things again, and I'm reporting you to the Captain.</font>

Campbell,

I heard from Mitchell that there's a load of Mentats at that school near West Roxbury. Some story about closets full of Mentats or something. I know there's a bunch of Super Mutants in the area, but I have a plan. See, we sneak into that school at night, get our hands on some of those chems, and then we'll be so smart we can figure out how to get out no problem! Trust me!

Thursday, 8th February, 1894. Off Cape Cod, aboard SS Wakeful.

I'm finally away. Emogene and Wilhelmina came to see me off, Emogene begging me not to go, as usual - poor girl, she takes these partings hard. Jack wasn't there, of course. He thinks I'm making a laughing-stock of the whole family with these expeditions - has no time for what he calls "ancient superstitions." No matter. This time I'll return with proof that even Jack will not be able to deny.


Saturday, 10th February, 1894. In the Atlantic, aboard SS Wakeful. 

The weather is fine and the captain promises a quick crossing to Lisbon. The red tape involved in organizing this expedition tried my patience almost to the breaking point, but I'm sure it was better to obtain the necessary permits from the Omani authorities through the State Department. I can only hope that my sheaf of documents (and ready cash) will be enough to placate the local governor when I arrive.


Wednesday, 21st February, 1894. In the western Mediterranean, aboard SS Wakeful. 

So far so good. Uneventful crossing. Metternich was waiting for us in Lisbon - with the welcome news that he had perfected his electrical sensing apparatus, which is now safely on board in its crates. If it works as well as he claims, this may save us weeks or even months of excavation work.


Monday, 5th March, 1894. Suez, Egypt.

Still waiting to finish hiring our team of diggers. I am beside myself with impatience to be on my way - we are so close now - but I know from long experience that we will have better luck with an experienced Egyptian team than relying on the locals.


Wednesday, 14th March, 1894. Salalah, Oman.

At last! We docked yesterday and have been unloading at a feverish pace. Any more delays and we will be in danger of having to postpone until the summer heat has passed.


Friday, 16th March, 1894. Near Wadi Aydam, Oman.

We are on our way. Nothing more stands in my way but the impenetrable desert and the secrets of the ages. Ha! I welcome those challenges - they seem like child's play after the endless delays and paper-shuffling bureaucrats I've had to overcome to get here.


Thursday, 29th March, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.

We have reached the spot without incident. Some superstitious grumbling from our local guide which I take to be a good sign. Tomorrow we see if Metternich's apparatus works. If not, we begin digging in the traditional way.


Saturday, 30th March, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.

Metternich's apparatus has been balky - sand in its delicate workings, no doubt - but he has obtained a favorable reading in a depression to the south. Heat during the day is tremendous. We'll set to work tomorrow and see what we see.


Monday, 2nd April, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.

Nothing yet at the southern depression. Metternich swears that it wasn't a false reading. 2 more days and then I'll have to begin a search grid across the whole site, as disappointing as that will be.


Tuesday, 3rd April, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.

Success! Late this afternoon, the diggers struck worked stone. Apparently the edge of a large circular structure. More trouble from the guide - the wisdom of not hiring the diggers locally now even more apparent, as they pay little attention to him.

Friday, 6th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

I'm now convinced we have found Ubar itself! We've uncovered several fragmentary inscriptions, with runes that match the ancient texts. We've made excellent progress clearing part of what appears to be a monumental plaza. 


Wednesday, 18th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

All work has stopped - sandstorm, one of the worst I've ever experienced. We are huddled in our tents in the lee of one of the large outcroppings and must hope to ride it out. The darkness is complete although it is mid-morning.


Friday, 20th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

Sandstorm continues for a 3rd day. Like nothing anyone has ever seen. The guide is becoming very troublesome - some of the diggers are beginning to listen to his wild tales of ancient curses and forbidden secrets. Even the normally phlegmatic Metternich is beginning to show signs of cracking under the strain.


Saturday, 21st April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

The sandstorm is over, but two weeks of work has been undone - the area we had cleared is now buried under several feet of new sand. The guide disappeared in the night - I won't miss him, but the diggers are even more unsettled.


Thursday, May 3rd, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

We've located what must be the foundations of the Great Temple! So far nothing but stone and rubble, but something must have survived. Weather getting worse by the day. Metternich talking again of resuming work in the winter, but I won't hear of it. Not when we're this close.


Sunday, May 13th, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.

I must record everything, while it's fresh in my mind. Although it's hard to concentrate with the crown right here in front of me. It's almost unbelievable, even to me, that I hold in my hands an artifact so clearly not made by any human civilization. But let me set down how it happened as clearly as I can.

We had worked for at least a week to clear the shaft beneath the Great Temple - even the diggers had caught the excitement. Then we hit solid stone - a cyclopean block (series of blocks, as it turned out) obstructing the tunnel, clearly deliberately sealed by the builders. We almost despaired of getting through - 3 days of laborious pick-work - I wouldn't risk explosives here of all places! - then, breakthrough into darkness.

I was first in - the dust of ages covered everything - clearly a burial crypt - sarcophagus at one end of the chamber. We lifted the lid, and inside - even I fell to my knees in shock. The diggers that were helping us fled; Metternich white-faced, I feared he was having a heart attack (luckily no).

We'll make a full catalogue of the tomb in the morning. I ordered it sealed up overnight - not that I really believe any of the diggers would dare to enter it again, but better safe than sorry. I removed only the crown, reverently, without disturbing the body or any of the other artifacts.

And so - vindication! The crown waits, gleaming as if new-made although I know it is older than any human artifact ever uncovered.

Later:

I now know that this city's name was not Ubar, and that this building was not a temple, and what was beneath it was not a crypt. I have so much to learn, and so much to teach Wilhelmina, and Jack, and Emogene. When we return, we will return together.


Monday, May 14th.

Metternich was extremely surprised to see me wearing the crown this morning, and tried to argue with me when I ordered the men to bury everything we've uncovered. It doesn't matter now. The sandstorms will erase all evidence that we were ever here long before anyone can stumble across this site again. And the city's location is now safe with me, until I can return and uncover more of her secrets - when I am ready.

<font face='$MAIN_Font' size='35'>77</font>

Bradlee,

Look, I know you've doubted me since we killed that guy who came into our camp, but this is how we do things. I don't have time to try and figure out if a newcomer is trustworthy or if he's gonna slit all our throats the first night.  I don't see it as a choice. I see a stranger, I kill them. It's for the good of the group.

The Synthetic Truth
By
Piper Wright
</p>[pagebreak]<p align="left">
Noodles. We all eat them. We all love them. And Diamond City's Power Noodles has supplied this sustenance for the past fifteen years. From the stilted mechanical cadence of Takahashi's programmed Japanese, to the fragrant steam that wafts from each bowl, to the scalding tang of each delicious mouthful - the ordering and eating of noodles is but one of many shared human experiences. Or is it?

I was struck by this very question as I sat at the counter of Power Noodles last Wednesday night, just after 5:00 pm, enjoying a dinner I had so many times before. That's when I noticed our very own Mayor McDonough sidle up to a stool, and engage in the very same ritual. Right hand extending. Mouth opening. Teeth chewing. Yes, eating noodles. The shared experience of almost every Diamond City resident.

So it must have also seemed to the residents of Diamond City nearly sixty years ago, on an uncharacteristically warm May evening in 2229, as they sat around this very same counter. But that was before the days of Takahashi and his noodles, when the bar served not noodles, but ice cold Nuka-Colas, frothy beers, and stiff shots of whiskey. The barman's name was Henry, and that night, he facilitated the shared human experiences of drinking, smoking, talking and laughing. That is, until tragedy struck.

There aren't many among us who are even old enough to remember that evening - although some of the city's Ghoul residents certainly could have, had they not been forcibly removed, thanks to Mayor McDonough's anti-Ghoul decree of 2282. But there is one person among us who does remember, distinctly, the events of that evening: respected matriarch Eustace Hawthorne, who recounted her story in a Publick Occurrences exclusive interview.

"Oh, I was there all right. Sitting right at the bar, sure as you're sitting in front of me now. Twenty-two years old or so, and just looking to have a good time. I was safe behind the Wall - we all were - so what was the harm? And let me tell you, that Mr. Carter made it easy. He came into town earlier that day, said he was from out west somewhere. It didn't really matter. What did matter was his smile, and his laugh, and the way he'd make everyone feel at ease. That night, at the bar, we all just sort of crowded around him. Everyone wanted to exchange a word, or hear about the state of the Commonwealth. And Mr. Carter, he was all too happy to oblige. It was just so wonderful. Until it wasn't."

Eustace continued her account of that evening, and the moment when things turned sinister, and the truth about Mr. Carter was revealed.

"We'd been drinking, and carrying on, must have been three hours. Mr. Carter had four or five drinks in that time. He seemed a bit drunk, I guess, like the rest of us. Then something just sort of happened. He was smiling, but the smile sort of went from his face, all in an instant. And then his cheek started twitching, kind of funny. And I remember watching him, clear as if it happened just yesterday. He reached inside his coat, took out a revolver, and then 'Blam!' - He shot Henry, the barman, right in the head. Didn't hesitate, didn't show any emotion - Mr. Carter killed Henry as casually as if he were paying him for a drink. But his cheek never did stop twitching. Let me tell you, all Hell broke loose after that."

What Eustace is describing is, of course, is the infamous event known as the "Broken Mask," when the people of the Commonwealth learned for the first time that the Institute, the shadowy scientific organization responsible for the creation of combat androids, had actually succeeded in creating a model so advanced, it could effortlessly infiltrate human society. Unbeknownst to the people of Diamond City, the Institute had somehow evolved their androids into true synthetic humans. Synths. 

"After he shot Henry, that Mr. Carter shot three or four other people, too. Like I said, all Hell broke loose. The guards came running, they opened fire, and Mr. Carter he kept shooting, and throwing people around left and right. Finally, those guards put him down. Seemed like they had killed a man who had flipped his lid. Gone crazy. And he lay there like a dead crazy man, sure enough. God, it was horrible. But then we saw the plastic and the metal - this was one of them early synths, you see - and we realized it wasn't a man at all. It was then we all knew. The Institute wasn't just 'out there.' The Institute was everywhere now. Among us."

It was never determined precisely why the synth known as Mr. Carter went on his killing spree. Some suggested he had somehow been remotely controlled by the Institute, who wanted to test his combat effectiveness. Still others felt he had simply malfunctioned (a hypothesis supported by the twitching cheek), and was never meant to kill anyone. But at that time, the "why" hardly seemed important. What mattered was that the humans of the Commonwealth had been truly infiltrated by an organization whose intentions and motives were, and still are, a complete mystery - using a model of synth even less advanced than the ones the Institute has in service today.

Which brings us to noodles. Specifically, the noodles consumed by Mayor McDonough last Wednesday night, in the same spot that Mr. Carter the synth went haywire, and mercilessly killed several people - after spending hours sharing an experience the people of Diamond City assumed was reserved for members of the human race. They were wrong.

Are we?

Dear Diary,

I finally told them tonight, and it was bad. Real bad. Dad was shouting, telling me I should be ashamed, that I had to get out of the house. Mom just cried, and somehow that hurt worse than anything else. She didn't say a word, not even when I packed my things. I can't go to John - he doesn't even know yet. Maybe he'll never know.

If it weren't for the cabin I wouldn't have a place to sleep. Just need some time to think. Last I was here, I was just a little girl playing clubhouse in this old cabin. Now I'm really scared. Will anything ever be right again?

<i>Continued from Part 2.</i>

It's easy for us to be cynical about the missing. We have spent so long knowing the Institute is out there, but knowing so little about them. They are not the only ones responsible for kidnappings, but the fact that they sometimes are, and the fact that we have been so powerless to stop them when they do, causes us to treat all victims of kidnappings as if they are a lost cause.

But the people left behind, those loved ones, friends, and neighbors who may never see the faces of those taken from them again, they do not have the luxury of being able to just look away. They have to carry that lost with them, even if everyone else tells them to move on and forget.

I asked <alias=Player> to make a statement to Diamond City. To give us an outsider's perspective on what it means to lose a loved one, and how he feels. Maybe, in some way, it's how we all should feel. Maybe we've forgotten what the right, human response to these tragedies are. 

"You can only take it one day at a time." <Alias.PronounCap=Player> said. "Just keep going. That's all anyone can do."

The man you're after is called Roger Warwick, except he ain't actually a man at all, he's a damn synth spy. Those institute bastards grabbed the real Roger and they put this faker in his place. Well, they might of fooled Roger's wife and kids, but they ain't fooled me.

Take these caps as half your fee. I'll give you another 500 when the deed is done, but I don't want any of this to connect back to me. I plan to take over the farm when Roger's gone and I need it to look legitamit.

Fear the Future?
By
Piper Wright
</p>[pagebreak]<p align="left">
We've all succumbed to it, at one point or another. No matter how brave, or how strong we actually are, the people of the Commonwealth have known fear. 

Ever since the "Broken Mask" incident of 2229, right here in Diamond City, when the first human-looking synth infiltrated and attacked a group of innocent settlers, we have lain awake in bed at night, terrified of the Institute and everything it represents.

Long have we dreaded the possibilities: Will someone I know be taken, snatched in the night for who knows what reason? Will one of my loved ones suddenly turn on me, because they are, in fact, a synth replacement? Or will the boogeyman finally step out of the closet and devour all who stand in its way?

We, the people of the Commonwealth, remember the past. We live in terror in the present. But must we also fear the future?

In an almost unthinkable series of recent events, the Institute has destroyed anyone in the Commonwealth who could conceivably stop them, including longterm player the Railroad, as well as the newly arrived Brotherhood of Steel. What's more, the shadowy, sinister organization has completed work on an advanced nuclear reactor that will provide them with nearly unlimited power for the foreseeable future. This surely means greater underground expansion, as well increased range of their teleporter technology (which, until recently, had been a closely-guarded Institute secret).

So what exactly does this mean for the Commonwealth, going forward?

"Nothing good" seems to be the consensus. In fact, most people assume the worst.

But isn't it possible these fears are unfounded? The Railroad may have opposed the Institute, but they also defended all synths - even those who would potentially infiltrate human society. And the Brotherhood's mighty airship may now lie a smoldering wreck - but was the neo-knightly order really interested in the Commonwealth's best interests anyway?

But perhaps the most compelling reason not to give up hope just yet is the fact that, if my sources are correct - and I know they are - the Institute is now under the direct influence of someone many of us have already met - the Vault Dweller. That lonely figure who came into our settlement searching for a missing child, and clearly found something else entirely. And maybe, just maybe, the Institute is all the better for it.

So be wary as we go into a new tomorrow, my friends. But stay strong. And always, always remember that humanity lives and dies on the surface. Humanity IS the Commonwealth. And maybe, just maybe, the Institute can be a part of that now.

Whenever I take a walk through Diamond City, there are so many things people tell me to be grateful for. Purified water, working lights, electricity, security. True, what we have would have been unthinkable even a few decades ago. But it's easy to forget that, even after all the progress we have made, we are still living in the shadow of the world that was. A world before the threat of radiation. Before the Super Mutant and the Feral Ghoul and the synth.

So, as fortune often has it, I crossed paths with <Alias=Player>. Vault Dweller. A person who is experiencing the Commonwealth for the first time. What would <Alias.PronounPos=Player> fresh set of eyes say about how far we've come? Is Diamond City the "Great, Green Jewel" we have always claimed it to be?

Before we begin to answer that question, we have to know who <Alias=Player> is. Where <Alias.Pronoun=Player> comes from. <Alias.Pronoun=Player> began our interview joking about <Alias.PronounPos=Player> time in the Vault. "It was just me and a thousand guinea pigs. They turned... carnivorous." Of course, this reporter knows that life behind the sealed gear doors of a Vault-Tec facility is actually supposed to be a bastion of the old world. A preservation of life before the bombs.

<font size='18'>Damn it. I'm sorry, sis.

I don't know what happened. I was covering the entrance like you told me. We had Tower Tom's little maggots on the run, then "Blam"! I remember a face full of plaster then nothing. When I woke up I was here in Beantown Brewery with Tower Tom's ugly mug grinning at me. They've been good to me so far, but I only think it's because they want our food.

Don't give them a thing, sis. I'll find a way out of here.

I know it's been a while since I last wrote you. Things are going well here in Goodneighbor and I have been busier than normal with work.  So busy, in fact, that I have some great news. I've saved up enough money to rent out a place here big enough for you and the kids to finally come join me! So start packing your bags! I think I can take a week off to come get you guys moved out here. We can finally be a family again!

I love you all so much.

It's easy for us to be cynical about the missing. We have spent so long knowing the Institute is out there, but knowing so little about them. They are not the only ones responsible for kidnappings, but the fact that they sometimes are, and the fact that we have been so powerless to stop them when they do, causes us to treat all victims of kidnappings as if they are a lost cause.

But the people left behind, those loved ones, friends, and neighbors who may never see the faces of those taken from them again, they do not have the luxury of being able to just look away. They have to carry that lost with them, even if everyone else tells them to move on and forget.

I asked <alias=Player> to make a statement to Diamond City. To give us an outsider's perspective on what it means to lose a loved one, and how <Alias.Pronoun=Player> feels. Maybe, in some way, it's how we all should feel. Maybe we've forgotten what the right, human response to these tragedies are. 

"No matter how much you want to give up, don't." <Alias.PronounCap=Player> said. "You have to have hope. That you'll see them again. Or at least, that you'll know the truth."

<p align="left">CASE: Earl Sterling's Disappearance

Client: Vadim Bobrov

Another disappearing act to unravel. Earl Sterling. Twenty-five year-old bartender at the Dugout Inn. One of the owners, Vadim Bobrov, noticed that Earl hadn't been into work for a few days.

Security was called in. No investigation, of course. "The Institute took him" is the unofficial word about town. Like always.

Vadim came into my office, half-drunk with a sob story about how he and Earl went way back, and that he just can't believe that Earl would get snatched up by the boogeyman. My gut says he's right.

Earl didn't have any enemies, at least none with motive enough to kill the guy. Not living with anyone, either, so I'll have to see if Vadim or someone else at the Dugout has his keys. I'd rather not have to explain to security why I was picking the lock on Earl's door, if I slip up and get caught in the act.

Whenever I take a walk through Diamond City, there are so many things people tell me to be grateful for. Purified water, working lights, electricity, security. True, what we have would have been unthinkable even a few decades ago. But it's easy to forget that, even after all the progress we have made, we are still living in the shadow of the world that was. A world before the threat of radiation. Before the Super Mutant and the Feral Ghoul and the synth.

So, as fortune often has it, I crossed paths with <Alias=Player>. Vault Dweller. A person who is experiencing the Commonwealth for the first time. What would <Alias.PronounPos=Player> fresh set of eyes say about how far we've come? Is Diamond City the "Great, Green Jewel" we have always claimed it to be?

Before we begin to answer that question, we have to know who <Alias=Player> is. Where <Alias.Pronoun=Player> comes from. To my surprise, <Alias.Pronoun=Player> did not have much to say about <Alias.PronounPos=Player> life in the Vault at all. Because <Alias.Pronoun=Player> spent all that time staring at a piece of frozen glass. Every day. For over two centuries. That's right, <alias=player> isn't just a Vault Dweller, <Alias.Pronoun=Player>'s an original Vault Dweller. <Alias.Pronoun=Player> spent <Alias.PronounPos=Player> entire time on the inside cryogenically suspended.

Mom,

Russell has been gone over a day now and I'm getting worried. We were going to wait to tell you, but we found an old holotape from before the war in the boat shed. It sounded like someone had stashed some chems in the drainage at the end of the canal. Russell thought we might be able to sell them to one of the traders. Maybe use the caps to buy another Brahmin.

I'm sorry we didn't tell you, we just wanted it to be a surprise. But that's the second one of those bugs we've seen today and I think something went wrong, so I'm going to have a look for him. Don't worry - I'm just going to take a quick peek and I'll be back soon.

So what does <Alias=Player> have to say about seeing Diamond City for the first time?

"I've been having too much fun blowing things up to think about it."

It's important to note that <Alias=Player> was not actually blowing things up at the time, and that perhaps <Alias.Pronoun=Player> was referencing the violence that is all too common when you're traveling outside the Wall to the more dangerous parts of the Commonwealth. How curious, though, that <Alias.PronounPos=Player> first reaction to the horrors and tragedies out there would be humor?

You see, <Alias=Player> has a son. Shaun. And even though they were in the relative safety of a Vault, someone broke in, and took Shaun from his parent, and that parent is now risking everything - wandering through this strange and unfriendly world of ours - in order to save Shaun from his kidnappers.

We all know the rumors and whispers that surround every missing person in Diamond City. The guilty looks we pass to mourning family members as we "thank the Wall that, this time, it wasn't us." You can end up dead in the Commonwealth for a million reasons. Why spend our time worrying about kidnappings? 

Why, indeed.

Nobody can get into Overseer Olivette's terminal.  The password might be corrupted.

There is no disputing it now. Former Mayor McDonough was a synth - an agent in the pocket of the Institute, who used his power and influence to do untold damage to Diamond City and the lives within it. Abandoned by his masters, there's no telling how many more people he would have hurt or killed had he not been stopped.

We have the truth, bitter as it is. We cannot predict how long it will take us to unravel all of McDonough's lies, to even begin to repair years of carefully orchestrated sabotage. Is the Wall truly secure? Will we ever know the fates of Diamond City's missing? Will the position of Mayor ever be entrusted to someone else?

Everyone in Diamond City, whether they would acknowledge it or not, lived in fear of the Institute striking at them. Now they have. The city is still standing. Our daily routines keep grinding away. We still work, and eat, and sleep, and hope for a better tomorrow.

Are you still afraid, Diamond City?

Painful words. So much of civilization was lost when the bombs fell, and we have rebuilt without the comfort and security of the old Vaults.

So what does <Alias=Player> have to say about seeing Diamond City for the first time?

"Can you even compare the two? The world out here? It's not even close to the one I left."

While we like to think of our city as a shining jewel, it's worth remembering that not everyone comes here by choice. Sometimes people are forced from the comforts of their homes, and as the largest settlement in the Commonwealth, this is where they end up. Most are just looking for refuge, but sometimes they come here desperately looking for something. Or someone.

You see, <Alias=Player> has a son. Shaun. And even though they were in the relative safety of a Vault, someone broke in, and took Shaun from his parent, and that parent is now risking everything - wandering through this strange and unfriendly world of ours - in order to save Shaun from his kidnappers.

The Boogeyman Banished?
By
Piper Wright
</p>[pagebreak]<p align="left">
We've all succumbed to it, at one point or another. No matter how brave, or how strong we actually are, the people of the Commonwealth have known fear. 

Ever since the "Broken Mask" incident of 2229, right here in Diamond City, when the first human-looking synth infiltrated and attacked a group of innocent settlers, we have lain awake in bed at night, terrified of the Institute and everything it represents.

Long have we dreaded the possibilities: Will someone I know be taken, snatched in the night for who knows what reason? Will one of my loved ones suddenly turn on me, because they are, in fact, a synth replacement? Or will the boogeyman finally step out of the closet and devour all who stand in its way?

We, the people of the Commonwealth, remember the past. We lived in terror in the present. But with the catastrophic explosion at the C.I.T. ruins quite obviously signaling the destruction of the Institute (which this reporter learned was actually located deep underground), the question on everyone's minds now is: has the boogeyman really been banished?

It would certainly seem that way.

As long as there's been an Institute, there have been those opposed to the shadowy, sinister organization. While most ordinary folk wouldn't dream of defying their merciless masters, the Railroad has waged a secret war against them for over thirty years. And the Brotherhood of Steel's arrival in the Commonwealth signaled the most overt opposition the Institute has ever faced. All empires must eventually fall. That said, perhaps it was never a matter of "if" but rather "when."

So what exactly does this mean for the Commonwealth, going forward?

That, dear readers, is the question. For the boogeyman may indeed have been banished, but isn't it possible other monsters may step out of the closet to terrorize us in the night? There are other players in the Commonwealth. None had been as strong as the Institute - but that's sure to change. Will they work with the Commonwealth, or against it? Are they for the people, or against us? 

This reporter hold onto hope, for one very specific reason. If my sources are correct - and I know they are - the Institute's destruction was actually orchestrated by someone many of us have already met - the Vault Dweller. it would seem that lonely figure who came into our settlement searching for a missing child actually found the monster that had taken so many children. And killed it.

So be wary as we go into a new tomorrow, my friends. But stay strong. And always, always remember that humanity lives and dies on the surface. Humanity IS the Commonwealth. And maybe, just maybe, with the Institute finally gone, we can have the future we all deserve.

So what does <Alias=Player> have to say about seeing Diamond City for the first time?

"Honestly, seeing everyone surviving out here? Rebuilding the world? It gives me hope."

Hope. When was the last time someone in our city talked about hope who wasn't some politician fishing for points in the next election, making empty promises at the Wall? But our outsider hasn't let the cynicism of our strange world get the better of <Alias.PronounObj=Player>.

This is all the more remarkable because of the reason <Alias.Pronoun=Player> came to the Commonwealth. You see, <Alias=Player> has a son. Shaun.

There are three components you need to find. They're fairly rare, but I'm betting you'll be able to find them.

~ Military-Grade Circuit Board - try old military bases
~ Biometric Scanner - hospitals and clinics are your best bet
~ Sensor Module - look in radio stations, radar sites, etc.

Just stay the course and keep doing what you do best, Knight.
Good luck.

Hank,
You've been eating a lot of that food paste that we got from that Suffolk school. It's affecting you. Like, in a real bad way, man. You've been flying off the handle at every little thing, always have this crazy look in your eyes. Heck, during that last farm raid you even shot up a couple of runners! We don't kill 'em when they're fleeing, man. We're better than that. I know the stuff tastes great, but is it really worth all this? I mean, I had to write this down because I'm scared you would shoot me in the face if I said anything in person. 
We're your friends. We just don't want to see you go down the wrong path. Just drop the paste, man.

Turrets repelled another two Raider attacks. 

Second attack was an organized probing attack. No massive threats (yet) but worried we'll be targeted soon. 

Need: 16 batteries, 2 cases of turret ammo (at least 4 batteries or we'll be out of juice after next big attack).

Recommend: Once Compound team recovers from Stockton retrieval, take out the "Fog Hill" Raiders. Need a permanent Raider solution, though. With a greater volume of subjects passing through we become a bigger target. Investigate Bunker Hill deal?

Day 14

My physiological evolution seems to have stabilized. The medical team says my muscle mass has more than tripled since the experiment began, and my neural efficiency has improved markedly. This particular strain of modified FEV has been a remarkable success - I appear to have received all of the anticipated benefits without the typical adverse effects.

My application to join the research team is awaiting the Director's approval. Although further tests may be in order, I hope to be able to assist with my own experiment in the coming days.</font>

Holotapes are laser-readable media storage devices. In 2077, we used Holotapes to record audio and data files, like music, journals, even games. While this may seem primitive to you, two hundred years in the future, this was a common and popular technology in our time.

You can play holotapes with the Terminal on this table. Press the 'Load' button, insert the Holotape into the slot, and close it. It should play automatically.</font>

1. Make sure the wires to the generator are all connected properly.  Last thing we need is another short blowing out the generator - Randy!

2. The generator MUST be on before turning on the signal tower.
(I suggest you stay out of the water when flipping the generator switch, just sayin'.)

3. You'll know the signal is playing when - well, you'll just know.  Once the feedback goes away it will sound like there's nothing coming out of the speakers.  There is, but only the mirelurks can hear it.

I sent Sturges to talk to Mayor Jackson about what I saw with The Sight. I mixed up another cocktail and I can feel it starting to take hold.

I have a feeling we're going to need The Sight again if we are gonna make it through this.

My father is dead. Everyone I loved and cared about was vaporized or lost in this barren irradiated shithole. Because of you.

I used to feel sorry for you. You lost your son. You missed out on every moment of his life. Now, I see it's only what you deserved.

I cannot live with myself. Due to my stupid trust in you I've destroyed humanity's best hope for the future. If there's any fairness in the world you'll never get a good night's sleep in what remains of your hopefully short, miserable life.

Whenever I take a walk through Diamond City, there are so many things people tell me to be grateful for. Purified water, working lights, electricity, security. True, what we have would have been unthinkable even a few decades ago. But it's easy to forget that, even after all the progress we have made, we are still living in the shadow of the world that was. A world before the threat of radiation. Before the Super Mutant and the Feral Ghoul and the synth.

So, as fortune often has it, I crossed paths with <Alias=Player>. Vault Dweller. A person who is experiencing the Commonwealth for the first time. What would <Alias.PronounPos=Player> fresh set of eyes say about how far we've come? Is Diamond City the "Great, Green Jewel" we have always claimed it to be?

Before we begin to answer that question, we have to know who <Alias=Player> is. Where <Alias.Pronoun=Player> comes from. In speaking to <Alias.PronounObj=Player>, <Alias.Pronoun=Player> stressed that <Alias.PronounPos=Player> time inside the Vault was normal. But what is normal for a Vault? This reporter knows that life behind the sealed gear doors of a Vault-Tec facility is supposed to be a bastion of the old world. A preservation of life before the bombs.

Item 1: Piper
Piper continues to be a serious concern. The girl has demonstrated a knack for digging up secrets, and could expose our relationship. What's needed here is an outside agent who can't be connected back to me.

Item 2: The Railroad
Still nothing substantive to report  on this subject. If, as rumor suggests, they are keeping a secret headquarters in the region, then we must assume they have spies and recruiters in Diamond City. They can't stay hidden forever.

Item 3: Hancock
That damn Ghoul who fancies himself leader of the rabble in Goodneighbor seems bent on destroying my reputation and credibility. Travelers who come back from there are starting to get more and more suspicious. Something had better be done quickly, or the tide of public opinion could turn against me.

Item 4: The Ghoul Farm
Those Ghoul farmers at the Slog are trying to improve their lot in life, and it's only a matter of time before they try to get back into Diamond City. If I can't enforce my policies, I won't be mayor for long. Perhaps you can send someone to discourage their efforts.

Item 5: The Minutemen
Frankly I don't much believe it, but the rumor is that the Minutemen are re-organizing. I doubt anyone could rally a bunch of paranoid farmers and settlers after what happened the last time. I mention it only to keep you informed in case preventative measures are needed.

<p align="left">CASE: The Mysterious Stranger

Sightings of a man dubbed "The Mysterious Stranger" have been popping up sporadically across the old U.S. for years now. 

Best case, the man's an amoral lunatic. 

Worst case, a prolific serial killer.

All anyone knows is his MO: appearing suddenly, killing without remorse, disappearing without a word. "The Stranger" has no known accomplices, no clear method for selecting his targets, no calling cards left behind. 

Sightings range from the NCR all the way to the East Coast, stretching back decades. Now he's come to the Commonwealth.

Last thing this place needs is another psychopath running amok. Time to start putting together the pieces to put this one away.

DESCRIPTION
Human male. Outfits vary, but most recent sightings describe a large overcoat and fedora (guy has taste, I'll give him that much).

One man? Multiple men? A Ghoul with minimal scarring? Might explain the long passages of time between sightings. 

Appears and disappears suddenly, suggesting preternatural infiltration abilities/access to advanced cloaking tech. 

All but earliest descriptions suggest "The Stranger" uses only conventional arms, making infiltration training more likely. 

(Perps like this make me wish the Institute had sprung for thermal detection before giving me the boot.)

SIGHTING LOCATIONS
- Commonwealth (confirmed)
- Capital Wasteland (confirmed)
- NCR (old rumors)
- Shady Sands (really old rumors)</p>

<font size='18'>They're getting real mad, Red. The last batch of stuff you sent to the brewery wasn't enough. And it smelled like urine.

Covenant is a safe place. Whatever bad happened to you in the past won't happen here. But we've all got a job to do. We need word-of-mouth to spread so eventually dozens of people a week come through here.

So, some guidelines:

* Be welcoming, but don't make visitors uncomfortable
* Any opportunities to encourage visitors to bring their friends, exploit
* NEVER talk about synths
* NEVER talk about the Institute


Lars,

I know there's no easy way to do this, so I'm just going to come out and say it.  I'm leaving you. I know doing it by letter makes me a coward, and I'm ok with that. I just couldn't stand being with you anymore. The way you just let everyone push you around and tell you what to do. Grow a backbone! Who wants a man like that? I'm staying with Paulo now. Yes, that Paulo. He may be a Ghoul, but at least he doesn't take crap from everyone. And he doesn't live with his mother like someone I know.

Dear WRVR members,

It has come to our attention that your station is in close proximity to one of the tower sites in our newly planned Relay Tower network. Your station may experience periodic intereference or disruptions when we deem it necessary to broadcast. 

If you have any questions or concerns beyond that please contact your nearest military branch. 

Thank you and have a great day!

It's a sweet setup, Jamal, it really is. Up so high you don't have to worry about nothing. That drop is the only thing that bothers me. You know how I get at nights, especially after I've been drinking. Up here, if I do go out for a stroll, it'll probably be the last thing I do.

John was pulled out to sea. The fish was huge! I told him not to tether the pole to himself, but he wouldn't listen. If only he hadn't put the keys in his pocket.

I thought they would be able to help me figure out if I'm a synth or not, but all they do is keep asking me about a baseball team. Hours and hours over the same question. Either I am, and this is some form of torture, or they have no idea either.

I can't take it any more.

<i>Continued from Part 2.</i>

It's easy for us to be cynical about the missing. We have spent so long knowing the Institute is out there, but understanding so little about them. They are not the only ones responsible for kidnappings, but the fact that they sometimes are, and the fact that we have been so powerless to stop them when they do, causes us to treat all victims of kidnappings as if they are a lost cause.

But the people left behind, those loved ones, friends, and neighbors who may never see the faces of those taken from them again, they do not have the luxury of being able to just look away. They have to carry that lost with them, even if everyone else tells them to move on and forget.

I asked <alias=Player> to make a statement to Diamond City. To give us an outsider's perspective on what it means to lose a loved one, and how he feels. Maybe, in some way, it's how we all should feel. Maybe we've forgotten what the right, human response to these tragedies are. 

"Find who's responsible, and make them pay." <Alias.PronounCap=Player> said. "Simple as that."

Our sources tell us that the Railroad has some sort of experimental or prototype robot in their headquarters. They're calling the "Predictive Analytic Machine," or "P.A.M." for short. If you could use this holotape to decrypt the security on P.A.M.'s terminal, it will force the unit to return to the Prydwen. I'm certain we could put P.A.M.'s computing power to good use. Otherwise, destroy it. We wouldn't want it to fall into the Institute's hands.

Word is that the gang up at <Alias=Dungeon> had a big score recently. If we can hit them hard enough, we could make off with a nice haul of caps.

Sorry, Jen, I don't know any more than you do. Arlen always was peculiar, but the old man was the heart and soul of this place. I'm going to miss him. And his daughter, too. Marlene was here just the other day - cutest little thing.

I think Nate was just as shocked - he went straight home after the meeting let out. Forgot all about our date. I'll give him a pass. This time.

Kristen,

You were right! This pen pal thing is a lot of fun! Gives me something to look forward to all week. It can get pretty lonely out here, but now I get excited whenever I see the mail carrier go by!

Anyway, I found some more spare wood planks, so I decided to add a "sun room" to the old shack. I mean, pretty much every room is a sun room when you've got a leaky roof, am I right? But I found some patio chairs and a couple of cinder blocks I'm using as a table. It faces the east, so sunrises are just lovely! Maybe someday you'll make the trek out here and see it with me. 

How are things going with you? Did you talk to that guy you've been eyeing? He sounded really handsome, you should go for it! I mean, what have you got to lose?
Anyway, hope this finds you well, and I look forward to your next letter!

Your pen pal,
Alexander

Hey kid,

If you're reading this, I just wanted to say thanks. Your friends in the railroad came and they are helping me get a fresh start.

Sorry about the gun, and thanks for helping me through a hard time.

Open notice to anyone with a gun and some ambition. 

Feral Ghoul activity is on the rise near <Alias=Dungeon>. They may not have much in the way of supplies, but they congregate near areas with good salvage. Plus, ridding the world of these monsters will bring a smile to your face.

Keep what you kill. No other reward given.
